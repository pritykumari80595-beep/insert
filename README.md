# insert
This Java program uses JDBC with a PreparedStatement to insert student records into a MySQL database. It loads the MySQL driver, establishes a connection, and takes user input for id, name, and marks using Scanner. Inside a loop, it inserts three records securely into the student table and then closes all resources properly.
